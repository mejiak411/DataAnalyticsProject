# DataAnalyticsProject
Fall 2023 Data Analytics Graduate Final Project

Instructions

General assignment: Your term projects should fall within the scope of a data analytics problem of the type you have worked with in class/ labs, or know of yourself – the bigger the data the better. This means that the work must go beyond just making lots of figures. You should develop the project to indicate you are thinking of and exploring the relationships and distributions within your data to lead to optimized predictive models. Start with a hypothesis, claim, or question. Think of one or more ways to construct a model(s)1, find or collect the necessary data, and do both preliminary analysis, detailed modeling, validation, summary (interpretation), and (if any) resulting decisions.

1. Abstract and Introduction (2%) Describe your motivation, initial hypothesis/ idea that you
wanted to investigate, and if applicable any prior work, interest in the topic (like an intro for a
paper, with references), Minimum 1/2 page.

2. Data Description and Exploratory Data Analytics (3%) 1NOTE: 4000-level students must
develop at least two different types of models and 6000-level students must
develop at least four different types of models, not just change the number of variables for a
given model type. 1NOTE: 6000-level students must use at least two datasets during
the analysis. Describe how you determined which datasets you used in this project, the
criteria, source, data and information types in detail, associated documentation and any other
supporting materials. Minimum 1 page text (+graphics if applicable).

3. Analysis (5%) Explore the statistical aspects of your datasets. Perform any transformations,
interpolations, smoothing, cleaning, etc. required on the data, to begin to explore your
hypothesis/ questions. Analyze the distributions; summarize the relevant statistics
and plots of any fits you made. Discuss and specify or estimate possible sources of error,
uncertainty, or bias in the data you used (or did not use). Minimum 2 pages text + graphics.

4. Model Development and Application of model(s) (12%) What types of models have you used to
describe the data (regression, classification, clustering, etc.), patterns/ trends you found, visual approaches that helped you choose models, and or variables (type/ number) in the model, other parameter choices or settings for the models (e.g. distance metrics, kernels, etc.). Apply the models to assess model performance (i.e. predict). Discuss the confidence in your results including any statistic measures. Discuss how you validated your models and performed any optimization (give details). Minimum 6 pages text + graphics.

5. Conclusions and Discussion (3%) Describe your conclusions; interpret the results, predictions
you made, the models and their characteristics, and a given summary of what changed as you
went through the project (data, analysis, model choices, etc.), what you would do next, or do
differently in a subsequent exploration.
Minimum 1 page text + graphics (optional).
References – websites, papers, packages, data refs, etc. You need to cite your
references in the body of the document properly and should include those properly cited references at the end. You can choose any citation format (Chicago, MLA, etc…) but be consistent when you cite your references (There is no specific citation format, just be consistent). Include your R scripts! (e.g. R codes in a zipped folder with the written part of the assignment and upload the zipped folder to LMS ) and also include the Github URL that contains the code.

6. Electronic version of the poster (5%). Please use the poster templates that are available on LMS.
a). Title (with your name) and Abstract
b). Problem area – what you wanted to explore/ solve/ predict and why, and what you wanted
to predict?
c). The data – where it came from, why it was applicable, and the preliminary assessments you
made. Include your Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA) section on the poster as well.
d). How you conducted your analysis: distribution, pattern/ relationship, and model
construction. What techniques did you use/ not use and why? What worked? What did not
work?
e). How did you apply the model? How did you optimize, and account for uncertainties?
f). What did you predict and what decisions (prescriptions) were possible? What were the
outcomes, and conclusions?
